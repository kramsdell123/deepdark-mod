# Note

This is unfinished, there is a lot of vanilla textures for placeholders, and a bunch of missing recipes. Only the pickaxe and the axe are currently craftable.

# Instructions

* Find an ancient city, or locate one with '/locate structure minecraft:ancient_city'

* Go to the reinforced deepslate rectangle, clear out the sculk veins, and you guessed it, light it with flint and steel.

* Go through the portal you lit.

* Look for warden ore, and mine it with a netherite pickaxe.

* Mine three more with a silk touch netherite pickaxe.

* Craft some deactivated tools with warden scales you mine.

* Go back to the portal and mine the corners of it with a deactivated warden pickaxe.

* Summon the warden boss with a structure like the wither's, replace the soul soil with reinforced deepslate, and replace the wither skeleton heads with the warden ore you got from mining with silk touch.

* Defeat the warden boss to get the warden's heart.

* Activate your tools like this:
