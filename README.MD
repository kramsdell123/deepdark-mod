This is my unfinished Deep Dark Dimension mod! I don't know what your gonna do with this but feel free to play around with it, just remember about the license.

# Note

This is unfinished, there is a lot of vanilla textures for placeholders, and a bunch of missing recipes. Only the pickaxe and the axe are currently craftable.

# Instructions

* Find an ancient city, or locate one with '/locate structure minecraft:ancient_city'

* Go to the reinforced deepslate rectangle, clear out the sculk veins, and you guessed it, light it with flint and steel.

* Go through the portal you lit.

* Look for warden ore, and mine it with a netherite pickaxe.

* Craft some deactivated tools with warden scales you mine.

* Activate your tools like this (I have cooked chicken as a placeholder for the warden's heart, whick is not obtainable yet):
